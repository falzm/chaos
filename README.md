# Chaos Go HTTP middleware:Â Introduce a little anarchy...

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/falzm/chaos?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/falzm/chaos)

*Chaos* is a HTTP middleware that can be used to inject chaotic behavior into your web application (such as delays and errors) in a controlled and programmatic way. It can be useful in [chaos engineering](https://principlesofchaos.org/) for testing a distributed system resiliency, or to ensure application observability instrumentation is working as intended.

The Chaos Middleware is configurable on-the-fly via a dedicated management HTTP controller. For earch target route (i.e. the actual HTTP endpoint that will be impacted by this middleware), it is possible to set a chaos specification defining either or both a delay artificially stalling the request processing and an error terminating the request processing with an arbitrary status code and optional message.

## Configuration Routes

For every configuration route, the following URL parameters are mandatory:

* `method`: the HTTP method corresponding to the target route (e.g. *GET*, *POST*...)
* `path`: the URL path corresponding to the target route, starting (e.g. "/api/a")

The available routes are:

```
PUT /
```

Set the chaos specification for the corresponding target route. The request body format is JSON-formatted and its content type must be `application/json`:

```
{
  "error": {
    "status_code": <int: HTTP status code to return for request termination>,
    "message": "<string: optional message to return for request termination>",
    "p": <float: probability between 0 and 1>
  },
  "delay": {
    "duration": <int: delay duration in milliseconds>,
    "p": <float: probability between 0 and 1>
  },
  "duration": <string: optional chaos effect duration in expressed in Go duration format*>
}
```

\*: [Go duration string format](https://godoc.org/time#ParseDuration)

Upon successful request, a `204 No Content` status code is returned.

```
GET /
```

Get the chaos specification currently set for the corresponding target route:

```
DELETE /
```

Delete the chaos specification set for the corresponding target route.

## Example Usage

For the following implementation with the Go standard library [net/http](https://godoc.org/net/http) package:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"net/http"

	"github.com/falzm/chaos"
	"github.com/gorilla/mux"
)

func handleAPI(rw http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	fmt.Fprintln(rw, "ohai!")
}

func main() {
	router := mux.NewRouter()
	router.HandleFunc("/api/{action}", handleAPI)

	http.ListenAndServe("127.0.0.1:8000",
		chaos.NewChaos("127.0.0.1:8666").Handler(router.ServeHTTP))
}

```

Set a 3 seconds delay with a 50% probability and a 504 error with a 100% probability for target route `POST /api/a`:

```
curl -X PUT -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
	-d '{"error":{"status_code":504,"p":1},"delay":{"duration":3000,"p":0.5}}' \
	'localhost:8666/?method=POST&path=/api/a'
```

Set a 599 error with message "oh noes" with a 10% probability for target route `GET /api/b`:

```
curl -X PUT -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
	-d '{"error":{"status_code":599,"message":"oh noes","p":0.1}}' \
	'localhost:8666/?method=GET&path=/api/b'
```

Get the currently set chaos specification for the target route `GET /api/b`:

```
curl -i 'localhost:8666/?method=GET&path=/api/b'
(returns Error: 599 "oh noes" (probability: 0.1))
```

Delete the currently set chaos specification for the target route `GET /api/b`:

```
curl -i -X DELETE 'localhost:8666/?method=GET&path=/api/b'
```

Note: requests affected by a chaos specification feature a *X-Chaos-Injected-\** HTTP header describing the nature of the disruption. Example:

```
X-Chaos-Injected-Delay: 3s (probability: 0.5)
X-Chaos-Injected-Error: 504 (probability: 1.0)
```

To use the middleware with [Negroni](https://github.com/urfave/negroni):

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"net/http"

	"github.com/falzm/chaos"
	"github.com/gorilla/mux"
	"github.com/urfave/negroni"
)

func handleAPI(rw http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	fmt.Fprintln(rw, "ohai!")
}

func main() {
	router := mux.NewRouter()
	router.HandleFunc("/api/{action}", handleAPI)

	handlers := negroni.New(
		negroni.NewLogger(),
		chaos.NewChaos("127.0.0.1:8666"),
	)

	handlers.UseHandler(router)

	http.ListenAndServe("127.0.0.1:8000", handlers)
}
```
